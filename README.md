# UseCase1
This program's login is a placeholder for the login list. The userlist is contained within USERS.csv, and the UserList class will interpret and store the list of users. At the moment, the standby login names and passwords are:

User: bromboni1997
Pass: Testing1

User: roberto5
Pass: Testing2

User: stickleg
Pass: Testing3

Account creation is not yet functional, but all of the fields work, including the password strength checker. Once the account creation is finished, the new users will be appended to the USERS.csv file.



UserFactory is a class that creates 3 different types of users: Patient, Pharmacist, & Doctor that are saved within an ArrayList. All three of these types are declared based off of what the user selects within the ComboBox. This ArrayList will then be written to the accompanying CSV containing user logins [WIP]
